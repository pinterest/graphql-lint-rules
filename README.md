# Pinterest GraphQL Lint Rules

This is a set of zero-dependency rules to be used with the [`graphql-schema-linter`](https://github.com/cjoudrey/graphql-schema-linter) package.

These rules are based on schema conventions we have established at Pinterest.

## Installation

#### Install this package somewhere that `graphql-schema-linter` can access it.

For instance, to package with your project, run:

```
npm install -D @pinterest/graphql-lint-rules
```

Or, if you want to use these rules locally across multiple projects, run:

```
yarn global add @pinterest/graphql-lint-rules
```

#### Add the following to your [configuration file for `graphql-schema-linter`](https://github.com/cjoudrey/graphql-schema-linter#configuration-file):

```json5
// The exact format here depends on what configuration format (JSON or JavaScript) you use
"customRulePaths": ["/path/to/npm_modules/@pinterest/graphql-lint-rules/rules/*.js"]
```

If you prefer, pass `--custom-rule-paths '/path/to/npm_modules/@pinterest/graphql-lint-rules/rules/*.js'` to `graphql-schema-linter` instead.

#### Finally, add the names of the rules you want to lint to the `rules` array of your config (or `--rules` flag)

For example:

```json
"rules": [
  "composite-fields-are-nullable"
]
```

## Lint Rules

### `composite-fields-are-nullable`

When a field has a composite GraphQL type (object, interface, union), it must not be declared as a non-null field.

#### Rationale

Composite fields are more often tied to a resolver that needs to fetch some additional data than are scalar fields. Any failure that results from that data fetch will cause a `null` value to bubble up the query tree unless the field is marked as nullable.

While it is possible to change a nullable field to non-null in schema updates, the reverse is a breaking change. The "safe" default behavior is to have these fields be nullable.

Caleb Meredith has written a [good summary of issues around nullability](https://calebmer.com/2017/08/25/when-to-use-graphql-non-null-fields.html).

#### Exceptions

The `pageInfo` field [is specified by the Relay cursor connections specification as a non-null field](https://relay.dev/graphql/connections.htm#sec-Connection-Types.Fields.PageInfo), and therefore violates this rule. Since it's more important to follow the spec than this rule, fields that use the `PageInfo` type are skipped.

As many schemas will have a nonzero number of exceptions to this rule, fields can be marked with an `@allowNonNull` decorator (which you must add to your schema) to skip this rule as well. Standard [`graphql-schema-linter` overrides](https://github.com/cjoudrey/graphql-schema-linter#inline-rule-overrides) will work as well.

Also, a list of exceptions can be added to the `rulesOptions`, so that entire scenarios can be excluded at once.

```json
"rulesOptions": [
  "composite-fields-are-nullable": {
    "exceptions": [
      "ErrorInfo",
    ]
  },
]
```

### `fields-camel-cased-optional-starting-underscore`

This rule will validate that object type field and interface type field names are camel-cased or start with an underscore.

#### Rationale

GraphQL field names should be valid GraphQL identifiers. For field names that have numeric names, one can use the approach to add an underscore to the start of the field name to make it a valid GraphQL identifier. This rule checks that field names follow the camelCase format, but also allowing for them to start with an underscore.

### `fields-do-not-return-json`

This rule will validate that fields do not return `JSON` or any other variation of it.

### `nodes-contain-entity-id`

When a type implements the `Node` interface, it must contain a non-nullable string named `entityId`.

#### Rationale

For cross-compatibility with other APIs, our model types need to expose the primary identifier that can be used to identify the object across services. We do not, however, want to use `Node`'s `id` field for this identifier, as clients expect `id` to be globally unique across model and type (which our primary identifier is not). By enforcing the presence of `entityId`, we ensure there is a field to expose both, without changing the standard `Node` interface and still allowing for exceptional cases.

### `relay-container-returns-connection`

This rule will validate that types that end in `ConnectionContainer` return types that end in `Connection`.

### `relay-connection-types-spec-pinterest-customization`

This rule will validate the schema adheres to [section 2 (Connection Types)](https://facebook.github.io/relay/graphql/connections.htm#sec-Connection-Types) of the [Relay Cursor Connections Specification](https://facebook.github.io/relay/graphql/connections.htm).

More specifically:

- Only object type names may end in `Connection`. These object types are considered connection types.
- Connection types must have a `edges` field that returns a list type.
- Connection types must have a `pageInfo` field that returns a non-null `PageInfo` object.

This is basically the same validation done in [`graphql-schema-linter`](https://github.com/cjoudrey/graphql-schema-linter), but with some extra validation:

- `edges` field must return a list type of an object type that ends in `Edge`.

### `relay-edge-types-spec-pinterest-customization`

This rule will validate the schema adheres to [section 3 (Edge Types)](https://facebook.github.io/relay/graphql/connections.htm#sec-Edge-Types) of the [Relay Cursor Connections Specification](https://facebook.github.io/relay/graphql/connections.htm).

More specifically:

- Edge types must have a `cursor` field that returns a type that serializes as a `String`.
- Edge types must have a `node` field return either a `Scalar`, `Enum`, `Object`, `Interface`, `Union`, or a Non-Null wrapper around one of those types.

Also, it adds some validation regarding Pinterest-specific rules:

- Only edge type names may end in `Edge`. These object types are considered edge types.

### `relay-id-field-type`

This rule validates that when an `id` field is used, it is of an `ID` scalar type that is assumed to exist in the schema as a string scalar.

Relay [imposes this requirement](https://github.com/facebook/relay/issues/1682#issuecomment-296393416) because it makes assumptions about any `id` field that it sees.
